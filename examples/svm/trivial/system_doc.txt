Simple Addition Library

This is a minimal Solana program library that provides basic arithmetic operations.

The library should implement an `add` function that correctly computes the sum of two u64 values.

The specification verifies that the addition is computed correctly for all possible inputs.

The default Rust behavior for overflow is fine, and there are no Solana-specific requirements to consider here: just have a quick implementation.
